# Committing changes

```{instructor-note}
Before starting the exercise session:
- Show how to verify whether we are on our fork and not on the original repository.
```

## Exercise

```{exercise} Exercise: Practice creating commmits and branches (20 min)
Make sure that you work now **on your fork** of the recipe-book repository.

1. First create a branch and then add a recipe to the branch and commit the change.
1. In a new commit, modify the recipe you just added.
1. Switch to the `main` branch and modify a recipe there.
1. Browse the network and locate the commits that you just created ("Insights" -> "Network").
1. Compare the branch that you created with the `main` branch. Can you find an easy way to see the differences?
1. Can you find a way to compare versions between two arbitrary commits in the repository?
1. Try to rename the branch that you created and then browse the network again.
