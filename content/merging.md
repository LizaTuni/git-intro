# Merging changes and contributing to the project

```{instructor-note}
Before starting the exercise session:
- Show how to open a pull request and how it can be accepted (merged).
```

```{exercise} Exercise: Merging branches with pull requests (20 min)
We assume that in the previous exercise you have created a new branch.
If not, create it first and add a recipe to your new branch.

1. Navigate to your branch and open a pull request.
1. In the pull request verify the target repository and the target branch. Make sure that you are merging within your own repository.
1. Open the pull request. Browse the network.
1. Merge the pull request. Browse the network again. What has changed?
1. Optional: Try to create a new branch with a new change, then open a pull
   request but towards the central repository. We will later merge few of
   those.
```
