# Copy and browse an existing project

```{instructor-note}
Preparation:
- Create an exercise repository from
  <https://github.com/coderefinery/recipe-book-template> preserving history
  (this means not using "generating from template")
- Create one or two issues
- Create one or two pull requests
- Try to search for something in the recipe to trigger a search index update

Before starting the exercise session:
- Show how to fork the repository to own account
```

```{exercise} Exercise: Browsing an existing project (25 min)
First **make a copy** to your own account to work on **by forking**
<https://github.com/coderefinery/recipe-book>

Then browse the project and explore commits and branches. Take notes and prepare questions.

1. Browse the commit history: Are commit messages understandable?
1. Compare the commit history with the network graph ("Insights" -> "Network"). Can you find the branches?
1. How can you find out when a recipe was last modified?
1. How many changes did the Guacamole recipe receive (you find it under "sides")?
   Try to click on some of the commits to see what changed.
1. Which recipes include the ingredient "salt"?
1. In the Guacamole recipe, find out who modified each line last and when
   (click on file, then click "Blame" button). Find out who added the cilantro
   and in which commit.
1. Who all has contributed to the repository?
1. Can you use these recipes yourself? Are you allowed to share modifications? (look at the license file)
1. Browse issues and pull requests, any idea what these might be good for?
```
